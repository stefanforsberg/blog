          So. Much. Talking. It might seem overwhelming, perhaps even a nightmare work environment for some. Negotiating different working styles, approaches, and views could easily turn into an
          arduous task. For us, it took about five months of constant discussion and trial and error. We were striving to align our individual strategies on how to execute our work, aiming to reach a
          common groundâ€”a consensus.

        <p>
          During that period, it was not uncommon to find ourselves in a labyrinth of ideas, opinions, and methods. But gradually, things started to fall into place. A certain rhythm was found, and
          more often than not, a shared understanding began to emerge. We started to instinctively know what our collective objectives were and how we were going to achieve them. It became more
          natural for the team to move in unison, to anticipate each other's moves, to work together as a cohesive unit.

        <p>Retrospective are more important than ever.</p>
