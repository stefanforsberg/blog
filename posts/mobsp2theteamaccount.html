          Argue with your IT department about why you should have a team account (an email address, a Slack account, etc.). It quickly becomes confusing for your colleagues if you speak from your
          personal accounts in the context of now working as a team. The transparency of having a team account and communicating via it mitigates this very well.

          Most often, it can go against (very reasonable) company policy to have individual accounts for traceability, etc. It took a few round of discussions before we found a way that felt okay for
          everyone involved.
