          This are some thoughts, a mini retro if you will, after the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/spelsylt8">Spelsylt 8</a> game jam. As per last time two themes were generated and you can mix and
          match as you see fit. This time the themes were announced about one week before the actual jam started.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Still very fun/good with two themes</li>
          <li>
            It was nice to get the themes a bit before the start to have some time to think before the actual creation began; about a week felt like a good extra time for consideration. My random
            selection of themes gave me two fairly simple ones, which I thought lowered the bar in a good way, but maybe also a bit boring as there weren't many different ways to interpret them. For
            next time, maybe have one more accessible word and one more esoteric?
          </li>
          <li>
            I tried to create the game before graphics and sound this time, which was nice. It also felt a bit less stressful. Inventing a sound to support a mechanic instead of inventing a mechanic
            to support a sound was a more enjoyable problem to have about two days before the deadline.
          </li>
          <li>No Godot this time either. I should try to recreate the game in Godot now that it's top of mind, but I have a feeling that it won't happen ðŸ˜…</li>
