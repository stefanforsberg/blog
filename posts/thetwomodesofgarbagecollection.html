          One of the reasons you might like working in runtime with garbage collection is that you don't need to worry too much about managing your memory. I've manage to stay fairly ignorant to the
          inner workings because for most of my job years I've been hosting my applications on somewhat beefy servers where memory is typically not a concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          The move to containers and running them in k8s has slightly shifted that reality or at least I've felt the need to have a bit better grasp on what options I have available to me in regards
          to the resources my application consumes. So there will hopefully be a few posts in this general area as I learn new things.

        <h4>Server GC and Workstation GC</h4>
        <p>When running an asp.net core app you by default have the garbage collector running in Server GC. The other available mode is called Workstation GC.</p>
        <p>As I mentioned running in server GC is the default and if you want to run in Workstation one option is to set the following in your csproj.</p>
        <pre>
<code class="language-xml">&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;ServerGarbageCollection&gt;false&lt;/ServerGarbageCollection&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code>
</pre>
        <p>Note that you cannot run in Server GC if the machine you're running on only has one logical CPU.</p>
