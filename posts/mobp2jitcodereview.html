        <p>
          Prior to mob programming our team has always faced challenges when it came to code reviews. Despite consistently identifying the need for improvement during our retrospectives, we struggled
          to make substantial progress. We aimed to build smaller features and devote more time to reviewing code, but we never seemed to achieve a sustainable, energy-efficient workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          With mob programming, the review process was integrated into our everyday work, occurring every few minutes as we collaboratively built features. This method ensured that everyone shared the
          same context, eliminating the burden of sunk costs associated with reworking a week's worth of effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although continuous, just-in-time code reviews might not always be more enjoyable, they make it much harder to avoid essential discussions about our work. By incorporating mob programming,
          we've managed to create a more efficient and effective code review process for our team.
