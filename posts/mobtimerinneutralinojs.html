        <p>
          At a lab day at work one of the task your mov could choice to work on was building a mob timer. I had done that some 8-isch years ago in electron so I took the opportunity to try another
          cross platform apps kits. After some light googling I settled on <a href="https://neutralino.js.org/">https://neutralino.js.org/</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was very simple to start following the guide to <a href="https://neutralino.js.org/docs/getting-started/your-first-neutralinojs-app">build your first app</a>. All in all I really liked
          the experience and while a lot of things have certainly happened to electron since I last looked the neutralinojs experience was very smooth and I could quite easily accomplish the simple
          app I set out to do. I felt like the backend API:s (to interact with the os etc) were readily available for me in a way that felt more straight forward compared to electron. Will definitely
          keep this framework at the back of my head should the need to create cross platform app occur again.
        </p>

        <p>Ofc I also spent way too long to get some nice rainbow thing going to signal who the active mob user currently is. It would not be lab day without it I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
