        <p>A service with a small well known purpose can often be a good candidate for trying out some other language and/or framework.</p>
        <p>
          I've found that the very reason it made a good candidate for trying something new (small and well known) often means that once it's up and running you will mot have many reasons to revisit
          it. Since it was new(ish) to you and your team to begin with it can often be hard to remember the ins and out of the language/framework when you do need to revisit it.
