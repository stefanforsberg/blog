          The demo ghost is that thing that causes a system to surprise you with all kind of unexpected behavior. This ghost seems to have a high tendency to decide to reveal itself when you're doing
          a demo, the bigger the demo the better (says the ghost).
        </p>
        <p>I've been fairly spared recently, maybe because the things I've developing for the past couple of years have been more internal systems with a very limited exposure to actual people.</p>
        <p>
          This week we had a relative big demo showcasing a system we've been working on. We had done a bunch of smaller demos beforehand so it felt like it was pretty much under control. As the
          person who held the introduction started to near the end of their slides and hand over to me I noticed that the CDN we use for a css library seems to suffer from degraded performance which
          causes our site to be very slow. Luckily enough it sorted itself out just as I started to demo so I thought I'd dodged a bullet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demo ghost had manage to lull me into a false sense of security because apparently they had planned to take down an external service we rely on. That API went down and that's also when
          it became very apparent that our user experience for when an error occurs was not great, not great at all. Luckily we had somewhat of a continuous plan so we were able to showcase what would
          have happened if the system had been available and with a small bump in the road we were able to complete demoing the full functionality.
        </p>
        <p>So bye for now demo ghost, hope we don't meet each other again too soon ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘»</p>
