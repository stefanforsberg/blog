          About seven or eight years ago, before I embraced mob programming, my children were in kindergarten, and I often had to stay home to care for them when they fell sick. Back then, remote work
          wasn't as widespread as it is today, so working from home wasn't really an option for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          During those days, I would often feel stressed about missing work. A significant contributing factor was that, as we worked individually on our own tasks, it was easy to block someone else
          who depended on my task's completion before they could start or progress on their own work. Knowing that my absence could potentially hinder others from getting work done was not a great
          feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when we adopted mob programming and implemented a one-task flow, I experienced a tremendous sense of relief. No matter what an individual team member was dealing with, the team's
          flow remained uninterrupted. This newfound joy of feeling dispensable brought an unexpected, yet welcome, sense of freedom and satisfaction.
