          We had made some changes to an application that had been running in production for about a year and the tests failed on the CI/CD machine. After the usual rounds of
          <em>"but how did this ever work?"</em> we concluded that if the test were run after the 15:th in a month they would indeed fail in the same way we saw in the CI/CD run. Because of course the
          bug itself was related to date/time in tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          We scratched our heads and jokingly started to talk about the odds of us, by mere chance, only adding features (and consequently running the CI/CD) in the first half of the month for roughly
          a year. We looked at the logs and lo and behold, that was exactly what had happened.
