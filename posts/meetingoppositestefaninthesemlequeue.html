          On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrove_Tuesday">Fat Tuesday</a> I stopped by one of my families favorite place to get a Semla on my morning walk. After paying I started to put what
          I bought in my bag so I overheard the lady after me talking to the cashier. Their conversation went something like this
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>Lady:</em> Hello, I called yesterday. I have an order for 65 semlor and some other things</blockquote>
        <blockquote><em>Cashier:</em> Ah right, I'll get started on packing. Are you by yourself?</blockquote>
        <blockquote><em>Lady:</em> Yes</blockquote>
        <blockquote><em>Cashier:</em> Ehmm... but... how are you going to bring all that with you?</blockquote>
        <blockquote><em>Lady:</em> Oh... right. I haven't thought about that. I'll sort that out, I got good bags</blockquote>
        <blockquote><em>Cashier:</em> Err, ok.</blockquote>

        <p>
          I got a mild stress increase just by listening to this conversation and in many way it felt like I had met the exact opposite version of myself. To be so chill that you would think that
          carrying 65 semlor <strong>and</strong> "some other things", by yourself would just sort itself out. Your bags would need to have some magical ability to shrink things like bags from some
          video game or something.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could probably learn something from her, and maybe she could from me. I couldn't muster the strength to linger around the cafe to find out how things sorted themselves but I'm pretty sure
          they did. Semlelady, thank you for a micro self reflection moment on a cold February morning.
